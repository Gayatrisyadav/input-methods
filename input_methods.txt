
INPUT METHODS

(1)Hardware Events:
-Compatibility: 100%
-In Hardware Events the activate needs to be always true so that the target window comes into the focus...because activate is used to make the target window focused.
Even though there are no visible background processes running there are some "background processes" in the background so the bot pays attention to those.
-Hardware Events speed is medium and by default they do not clear the empty.
-If neither of the checkboxes are selcetd then by default this is selected.
-Hotkey support provided.
-Auto empty is disabled.

(2)Window Messages:
-Compatibility: 80%
-There is no need to keep the activate true..by default it brings the process to the foreground
-It too has same speed as that of Hardware.
-hotkey support provided.
-Auto empty is disabled

(3)Simulate:
-Compatibility: 99% - web apps
                60% - desktop apps
-It is the fastest among all three.
-The only disadvantage it has is it does not provide support for Hot keys.
-The special thing about this is that the auto empty is on...there is no need to check that box separately.
